      <h1>Business Bankruptcy in the U.S. Virgin Islands</h1>
      <p>Local counsel for owners and managers in St. Thomas, St. John, and St. Croix. Protect value, stabilize cash flow, and choose the right path forward.</p>

    <div class="intro-text">
      <h2>When should a business consider bankruptcy</h2>
      <p>If short-term fixes keep failing, if creditor pressure risks payroll or essential vendors, or if long-term contracts and leases are no longer workable, it is time to model a court-supervised strategy. We will evaluate liabilities, executory contracts, leases, personal guarantees, tax exposure, and prospects for continued operations.</p>
    </div>
  </section>

  <section class="bg-gray">
    <h2 class="section-title">Chapter 11 reorganization, built for ongoing operations</h2>
    <p>Chapter 11 lets a company keep operating under the protection of the automatic stay while proposing a plan that restructures debt into sustainable payments. Typical levers include rejecting burdensome leases, curing arrears on essential contracts, restructuring secured loans, and negotiating treatment with key vendors. For qualifying small businesses, Subchapter V streamlines the process with faster timelines and lower administrative cost.</p>

      <li>Clear timelines, filing milestones, and communication with owners and key employees.</li>

  <section class="bg-white">
    <h2 class="section-title">Chapter 7 business liquidation, when winding down is the best outcome</h2>
    <p>If operations are no longer viable, Chapter 7 provides an orderly shutdown. A trustee gathers and sells assets and distributes proceeds to creditors. Owners of corporations and LLCs may limit future exposure tied to the entity’s debts, while focusing on their next venture. We prepare owners for records turnover and post-closing issues so there are no surprises.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="bg-gray">
    <h2 class="section-title">Out-of-court alternatives</h2>
    <p>Not every business needs a bankruptcy case. We frequently negotiate standstill agreements, payment workouts, forbearances, and structured asset sales to avoid filings. When appropriate, we also consider state law options and coordinated wind-downs that minimize disruption to customers and staff.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="bg-white">
    <h2 class="section-title">Sole proprietors and personal guarantees</h2>
    <p>If you operate as a sole proprietor, or if you signed personal guarantees, we may pair a business strategy with a personal Chapter 13 or Chapter 7. This consolidates pressure into a single plan, protects essential assets, and brings a faster path to stability. Cross-chapter coordination is part of our first meeting.</p>
